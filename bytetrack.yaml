# ByteTrack tracker settings

# ByteTrack: A Simple, Fast and Strong Multi-Object Tracker
#
# This configuration is for the ByteTrack algorithm, which is used for tracking objects
# detected by YOLO. ByteTrack excels at handling occlusions by keeping track of
# low-confidence detections and using them to re-identify objects that have
# disappeared and reappeared.

# Tracker type: Specifies that we are using the ByteTrack algorithm.
# Other options might include 'botsort'.
tracker_type: bytetrack

# High confidence threshold for track initiation.
# Detections with a confidence score above this value are considered high-confidence
# and are used to create new tracks.
track_high_thresh: 0.5

# Low confidence threshold for associating with existing tracks.
# Detections below 'track_high_thresh' but above this value are kept in a separate
# pool and used to re-identify lost tracks during the second matching stage.
# This is key to ByteTrack's robustness against occlusion.
track_low_thresh: 0.1

# New track threshold.
# A new track is only created if a high-confidence detection cannot be matched to
# any existing track and its score is above this threshold. This helps prevent
# creating new tracks for duplicates of already-tracked objects.
new_track_thresh: 0.6

# Frame buffer for tracks.
# This is the number of frames a track is kept alive after it is no longer detected.
# If the object reappears within this buffer window, it will be re-identified.
# If not, the track is deleted. A value of 30 at 30 FPS means the tracker will
# remember a lost object for 1 second.
track_buffer: 30

# Matching threshold for the tracker.
# This is the IoU (Intersection over Union) threshold used to associate detections
# with existing track predictions. A higher value requires a closer match.
match_thresh: 0.8

# Fuse score into tracking cost.
# This is the missing parameter. When enabled, it incorporates the detection
# confidence score into the matching cost, which can improve tracking accuracy.
fuse_score: True

# --- Gating for motion ---
# Aspect ratio and area filtering can be enabled to filter out irrelevant detections
aspect_ratio_thresh: 1.6
min_box_area: 10

# --- Kalman Filter parameters ---
# These are advanced parameters for the motion model. Default values are usually fine.
# std_weight_position: 0.0125      # Standard deviation of the position in the state vector
# std_weight_velocity: 0.1         # Standard deviation of the velocity in the state vector
